Currently the Jupyter notebook will take you through examples of running a single simulation, multiple simulations, umbrella sampling, and multiple umbrella sampling systems. The multiple umbrella sampling systems is still a bit in the work. When I run the system on Agave I can only spawn 29 simulations before I am told that the there is not enough memory to spawn another simulation and the SimulationManager crashes. Works perfectly on Javelina currently.
