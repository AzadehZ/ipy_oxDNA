## Introduction
oxDNA is a molecular dynamics simulation code that can be used to study the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of DNA and RNA molecules. Umbrella sampling is a simulation technique that is used to calculate the free energy profiles between two particles or groups of particles. The `ipy_oxDNA` repository provides a python interface for running oxDNA umbrella sampling simulations, allowing users to easily perform these simulations and analyze their results.

## Prerequisites
Before using this code, you will need to have the following installed:
- Python 3
- oxDNA
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ipywidgets (for Jupyter Notebook)

## Installation
To install the `ipy_oxDNA` code, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/mlsample/ipy_oxDNA.git

## Usage
The code can be used by importing the necessary modules into your python script or Jupyter Notebook. A tutorial on how to use the code can be found in the `scr` directory.

## Example Notebooks
This repository includes a number of example notebooks that demonstrate how to use the code to perform oxDNA umbrella sampling simulations. These notebooks can be used as a starting point for your own simulations.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!

## Citation
If you use this code in your research, please cite the accompanying academic article that will be published soon.
