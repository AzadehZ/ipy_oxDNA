## Introduction
oxDNA is a molecular dynamics simulation code that can be used to study the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of DNA and RNA molecules. Umbrella sampling is a simulation technique that is used to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) between two particles or groups of particles. The `ipy_oxDNA` repository provides a python interface for running oxDNA umbrella sampling simulations, allowing users to easily perform these simulations and analyze their results.

## Prerequisites
Before using this code, you will need to have the following installed:
- Python 3
- oxDNA
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ipywidgets (for Jupyter Notebook)

## Installation
To install the `ipy_oxDNA` code, simply clone the repository to your local machine:
